first cut:	need to use 1/8 ply not 3/32 sheet
		forgot notch on top plate for the tab on the back plate
		need top plate to be wider to give battery more room
		need more room in front of flight controller for the aio vtx
		had extra slots in middle plate not needed
		spacing for fastener holes is good but if top plate is widened
		then they will probably need to be moved
		be sure to include a holes in the back plate for the battery
		connector and the 2.4 GHz antenna
		add slots for battery straps on top plat
second cut:	jigs had several flaws, the one for cutting the channel for the
		half lap joint was too narrow and the one for glueing it square
		had incorrectly fitting tabs
first flights:	hover test had extreme wobble on default settings, reduced pids
		by 33%. next hover had wobble but was stable. first park flight
		wobble was noticeable but flyable. hovered at about 25% throttle
		and was suprisingly agile. crashed when a propeller dismounted
		during a throttle punch and broke the arms and center hub. I 
		think the wobble is prop wash as it seemed to only occur on
		takeoff and when entering dirty air.
third cut:	realized that bottom mount battery introduces a weakness for
		attatching battery unless the velcro slides underneath the stack
		because the new design relies on glue to attatch the plywood to
		the booms. combined weight of plywood pieces is a big approx
		27grams which is unfortunate.
printed a housing for the camera/vtx. width is 21mm and the mounting holes are at the bottom back of the piece
